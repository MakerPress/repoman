These scripts are used to create new instances of the Gollum servers.

make_client.py -- creates a new server using the current gold master Gollum image
set_keys.py -- sets the permsiions and keys for collaborators.  This should be run
   each time you update the list of collaborators.

make_client.py
--------------
Run this script to create a new server with the latest Gollum image.  
You must supply it with a URL that defines the project.  You get
this URL in the Django app for managing the project.  Depending on RackSpace, it
might take 2 or three minutes for the project to build and for the server to 
be ready.

Usage is:
      -s <url>   : Specifies source URL for JSON data that describes the project
      -p         : Prints the JSON
      -h         : Prints the help info
   

Here's an example: 

----
$ python make_client.py -s http://admin.makerpress.com/selfpub/project/test-ano/json

You can log into this server as root@50.57.81.57
